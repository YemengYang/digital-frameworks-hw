Don’t get too comfortable with the ‘pause’ in subprime lending

By Yemeng Yang

Subprime loan originations for three out of four major credit products declined for the first time since 2012, a TransUnion data set released last Wednesday found.

Originations of subprime auto loans, personal loans and credit cards dropped 5.3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to 4.63 million, the data set showed. Subprime mortgages, a lower-volume category, were the exception, rising nearly 10 percent to 47,125.

Researchers consider the declines in the three categories to be only “a pause” on the part of lenders after several years of heightened subprime activity and rising delinquencies, according to a press release issued by the credit reporting agency.

“Lenders are seeking to maintain the proper balance between return to investors, services to consumers and potential losses,” Ezra Becker, senior vice president of research and consulting for TransUnion, said in a phone interview. “This is a temporary, periodic correction.”

It’s unclear how long the pause will last. The report offered no forecast for coming quarters, and Becker said “much of this will be dictated by the delinquency picture in the near term."

The dataset defined subprime as loans made to consumers with VantageScore 3.0 credit scores of 300-600 (out of a range of 300-850) in the quarter that the loans were originated. The latest origination data available was for loans made in the first quarter because of reporting lags, officials said.

Subprime personal loan originations in the first quarter declined 10.6 percent to 882,303, compared with a positive annual growth rate of 11 percent a year earlier. That marked three straight quarters of year-over-year declines in origination.

In the credit card market, subprime originations declined 1.8 percent to 2.7 million in the first quarter. Subprime credit card originations had increased at a rapid rate since 2014, averaging growth of 29.2 percent in the first quarters of 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Subprime auto loan originations declined 8.9 percent to 1.1 million, compared with a 2.9 percent drop in total auto originations.

The pullback in subprime loans originations coincides with recent increases in delinquency rates for consumer credit. The latest delinquency data was from the second quarter and related to all risk categories, not just subprime.

Looser lending standards over past years have contributed to an uptick in overall auto delinquencies. The auto delinquency rate increased 10.8 percent to 1.23 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.

Lenders have also seen the downward pressure on used-car values, which hampers origination growth, the report said.

"The reduction in subprime auto lending is a natural reaction to the emergence of that increased delinquency," Becker said in a statement released alongside the data.

The overall credit card delinquency rate increased by 13.3 percent, to 1.46 percent, which is above the average second-quarter delinquency reading of 1.27 percent for the last three years.

Personal loan originations declined for all risk tiers, but at lower rates than for subprime originations. The overall personal loans delinquency rate declined by 8.5 percent, to 3.02 percent.

To be sure, the mortgage delinquency rate reached the lowest level in the second quarter since the recession. The mortgage delinquency rate was 1.92 percent, dropping below 2 percent for the first time in almost 10 years.

Mortgage delinquency rate reached 7 percent in the recession, and it took almost a decade to recover, Joe Mellman, senior vice president and mortgage business leader for TransUnion, said in a statement. Mortgages are now at the lowest delinquency levels in nearly a decade.

The slowdown in subprime lending is a sign of a healthy economy, Becker said.

“It is good for lenders to continue to find balance between all priorities they have, and it’s good for consumers not to overextend themselves in their use of credit,” Becker said.

TransUnion provides credit information and information management services to businesses and consumers. It releases data for consumer credits quarterly.
