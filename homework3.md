Physicians give more money to Texas Congress freshman Jodey Arlington, who voted in support of the health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, than any people with other occupations.

Physicians donated $41,150 to Rep. Arlington in the first half of 2017, accounting for 17% of total money contributed by individuals.
